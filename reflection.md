At the end of our final project exhibition night, Professor Inbar commented that with *8135 Baltimore Avenue* I had "created a syntax" for an unique type of experience---neither a video game nor a documentary, but in some ways both---that I could carry into future projects. This "syntax" was something she challenged us to develop throughout the semester, as my team and I reckoned with how to infuse so many genres and mediums into a coherent narrative. 

Our references were all over the place, from [interactive web documentaries](https://www.nfb.ca/interactive/welcome_to_pine_point/) to [immersive spatial journalism](https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/interactive/2021/public-transportation-free-fare-future/) to [hand-drawn scrollytelling](https://www.newyorker.com/news/a-reporter-at-large/china-xinjiang-prison-state-uighur-detention-camps-prisoner-testimony). We were blurring the lines between memory, speculation, and reality with by transforming our investigative research---street interviews, 3D scanning, and field recordings---with fictional touches: voice acting, photo editing, even AI. Throughout production, I was reckoning with discussions from Professor Sapienza's class about appropriation and the archive effect, from Dr. Moro's class about memory and mediation, from Dr. Farman's class about 360 journalism, from Dr. Parham's class about storytelling through games. I consider *8135 Baltimore Avenue* to be the "Capstone" of my Digital Storytelling & Poetics portfolio, synthesizing theory and case studies from many of my DSP classes into a transmedia project.

Through DSP's coursework, I have developed the ability to point to a digital work's influences in art and computing history. In Dr. Parham's and Dr. Moro's classes, we discussed hypertext and interactive fiction, generative poetry, NES games, video art; after class, I was checking out punk shows and reading event scores from Fluxus happenings. The vocabulary I was developing both inside and outside of digital storytelling genres developed my ability to perform media-specific analysis, which I demonstrated in my critical essay on *Kentucky Route Zero*. Interested in the interpretation of gameplay as performance, I explored both the electronic and embodied influences of *Kentucky Route Zero* in the essay. My media autobiography *Rise of a Videogame Zinester* and my stack report *This Barbie is a VR Headset* likewise demonstrate my ability to critically reflect on an artist or medium's historical lineage, but also present this information with the affordances of digital media. 

*PLEASE UNPLUG THIS INSTALLATION WHEN NOT IN USE* was my first completed piece for the portfolio, and it marks the beginning of my reckoning with materiality as a proposal for a physical installation. The installation responds to conversations about sustainability in the art world, sparked by the energy-intensive processes of minting NFTs and training AI models that are trending in the new media space. While AI grows more powerful and pervasive than it had ever been in my life, so does misinformation. Recently I received notice that I have been accepted into Immersive Media Design's New Works Incubator to develop the project further.

My goal in enrolling in the Digital Storytelling and Poetics minor was to learn more about digital humanities research and concentrate my technical skills towards literary and journalistic experiences. Digital media provides almost endless possibilities in how to present knowledge: as plan prose, as hypertext, as video, as tactile installation. Studying archives and electronic literature as part of this minor has made me more intentional with my use of media based on what I want to express: as Professor Inbar but it, I have developed a "syntax" towards my own style of digital storytelling that is foundational to my identity as a new media artist.

# Welcome!

### My name is Caroline Dinh and I am Immersive Media Design B.S. candidate for the class of 2024.

During my final year at the University of Maryland, I grew interested in electronic literature and digital humanities in a way that my primary coursework in the [Immersive Media Design major](https://imd.umd.edu/){:target="_blank"} hadnâ€™t yet exposed me to. My coursework in the Digital Storytelling and Poetics minor has supplemented the technical and studio experience of my major with a deeper investigation of the media history, critical theory, and storytelling practices behind creative technologies.  

Growing up in the D.C. area has given me the privilege of free access to extensive galleries and museums, though only recently did I start exploring the city beyond the Smithsonian. Learning about **D.C.'s punk history** and getting involved in the **local zine scene** sparked my interest in archives, when I visited the [People's Archive at the MLK Library](https://www.dclibrary.org/plan-visit/martin-luther-king-jr-memorial-library/peoples-archive){:target="_blank"} and the [D.C. Punk and Indie Fanzine Collection](https://archives.lib.umd.edu/repositories/4/resources/411){:target="_blank"} here on campus. Discovering my grandmother's poetry and the e-mail communications of my parents, aunts, and uncles from their '90s college campuses makes me particularly interested in **self-documentation** and **preserving cultural history** as a Vietnamese-American whose family has been in the DMV since '75. Whether or not these interests lead me to grad school, I want to stay engaged with local archives and history through personal research and creative projects.  

I have also been involved in the education space since high school as a makerspace volunteer, coding instructor, environmental educator, and workshop leader. My interest in **D.I.Y.** and **open-source culture** has me imagining creative and accessible alternatives to traditional computer science education, which has taken the form of [algorave](https://algorave.com/about/){:target="_blank"} workshops and [critical tech zines](https://cdinhart.itch.io/). My interest in pedagogy complements my research and creative interests by prompting me to consider how to present stories and information.

My Digital Storytelling & Poetics coursework serves as a foundation for the type of work I hope to do in the future. The projects in my portfolio have synthesized my ability to write critically about art, to present educational experiences using digital media, and to conduct investigative and archival research for non-fiction narratives. After I graduate, I hope to stay playful with design and emerging technologies. I will be watching the fields of **immersive journalism, educational technology,** and **new media art** for opportunities to experiment. I also hope graduation will free up time to write novels, build Twine games, learn guitar, and attend more punk shows.

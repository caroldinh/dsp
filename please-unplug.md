**PLEASE UNPLUG THIS INSTALLATION WHEN NOT IN USE** is an interactive projection mapping installation about balancing institutional and individual responsibility for the climate crisis. I conceptualized this installation during IMDM350 and have submitted this proposal to the Immersive Media Design New Works Incubator to fully develop over the summer.

## PROJECT PROPOSAL

## PROTOTYPE
Our assignment for the IMDM390 final project was to create a prototype of a project idea we had proposed in a previous assignment. I prototyped the visuals and logic using Processing. Below is a video demonstration.

## CONCEPT ART
To present my project pitch to the class, I created two concepts for how the installation would be executed, using Photoshop with assistance from DALL-E.

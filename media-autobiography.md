Our first assignment of CINE419E was to create a "media autobiography" analyzing our relationship to media throughout our lives. We were asked to write reflections on 20 pieces of media that impacted our lives, and present these reflections in a StoryMap embedded with audiovisual media. While writing my media autobiography, I noticed the same few themes kept coming up: the evolution of my music taste, the development of my digital literacy, the tension between print and digital mediums, my exploration of local history, my engagement with critical media theory.

In ENGL388T, we played *Kentucky Route Zero,* a magical realist video game resonating with our coursework on the history of computing and electronic literature. I chose to write about this game for our critical essay assignment, where we were tasked with analyzing one creative work from our syllabus with any two critical readings we had discussed in class. My citations for this essay strayed a bit from the course material but Dr. Moro generously allowed it.
